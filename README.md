# TASK

UI:

This is just a mock up of the first screen. The full functionality of UX can be felt only with the use of custom UI that pairs well with the Fabstations colour palette.

Future Implementations:

*Clicking on the actual button can open up a small tool tip about the button that displays its functions when the help mode is turned on. This will help the user to know where the button is instead of the user searching for the button in the help panel and the actual work screen.

*Create custom UI pack with simple icons that define the meaning instead of having the text under the button that do not align with the buttons

*Come up with a custom font to be used all over the Fabstation app.


Angle Calculator:

Clicking on the plane generates a line using a line renderer and the arc is filled once both the lines are generated.

Known issues:
Arc does not fit in between the lines when the angle is facing towards the left hand side.

Pivot Placer:

Select the “Set Pivot” button to place the pivot on the model, then click and hold the left mouse button to rotate the model through its new pivot.

MiniMap:

Hovering over the minimap shows a hover state that highlights where to place the camera.
